DBZ GAME CREATED BY @ZerxysZ

first time experimenting with pygame by following Tech With Tim's tutorial on youtube. 
I implemented a plethora of changes on the side to be a bit more creative, and im sastisfied with the overall outcome of the project.


To run the code, all you have to do is download the file, extract it, and then run the "main.py" file located in the folders directory.

I look forward to experimenting more with pygame considering the crazy ideas I have for future projects, therefore stay tuned! :)
